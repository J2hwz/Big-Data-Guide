This (unofficial) guide offers some basic tools and strategies that we think you might find useful, so that you put your amazing research ideas into work without getting stuck on the practical bits (although you will most likely get stuck anyways). This is by no means all you should know or all you should expect you should know (and not officially a part of the course content). These are just some things that previous students on the course found important to know. We hope it helps. 1.1 How to use this guide Just flick through the pages and find whatever is useful to you. 1.2 General strategies for the course This course is hard so prepare to kiss your first class honours goodbye. But if you put the effort in, it’s highly rewarding, no matter what mark you get. The main part of the course is your research project, which is grounded in what you learn in the lectures and tutorials (so you better show up to them). Participate, ask questions, talk to Zach, he’s there to help (and we are here too). You will learn by doing (and googling when things don’t work - follow on to the next section). 1.3 How to search for stuff you don’t understand Learn how to read documentation for libraries/functions, most can be found on CRAN. you can search a function in the documentation by typing this into the console: ?cor.test you can also use two question marks to search the documentation for a word or a phrase: ??tokenize Most packages have a tutorial or readme document that explains how and when to use them. (search for them!) ChatGPT can help with code but using it means you won’t actually understand the code. Better to just follow a tutorial and implement it yourself. 1.4 About us Joshua (s2144522@ed.ac.uk) Jana (s2158655@ed.ac.uk) Do let us know if there are errors on this guidebook.
