Why? Your findings are only as good as your data. If your data is bad, or if it’s going to be really hard to clean up your data to get a nice dataframe to work with, our advice would be to look for something else. Luckily there’s really so much data out there and you can find plenty of avenues to get started below. Once you have your data, start to think about the following: What psychological questions can I ask with the data? What psychological theories can I test with the data? (note: This is really important for a cohesive project!) Is the data mainly text- or numerical- based? What sort of methods/analysis can I run on the data and what results do I anticipate from them? This advice is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully it is helpful to get you started! 5.2 Datasets BROAD Kaggle Niderhoff’s repository of NLP datasets Awesome Public Datasets repository u/Istrakh’s Reddit post Public APIs repository u/Stuck_In_The_Matrix’s Reddit comments datasets SPECIFIC Khodak et al. (2018) Reddit /s sarcasm Dataset of r/AmITheAsshole comments Dataset of r/TipOfMyTongue 5.3 Project Ideas Start looking at hot topics from computational social science journals such as: Computational Social Science Big data and society Social media and society Social network analysis and mining Don’t copy, just get inspired Some ideas we came up with (will add more if we get creative): r/TipOfMyTongue and link it to the actual memory literature to see which sorts of events it predicts to be most memorable 5.4 Useful Resources 5.4.1 Reference Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach (Julia Silge &amp; David Robinson) Text As Data (Chris Bail) Text Mining for Social Scientists (Felix Lennert) Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R (Emil Hvitfeldt &amp; Julia Silge) R cheatsheets An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R (easier) Elements of statistical learning (harder) R for statistical learning (David Dalpiaz) 5.4.2 Other useful resources Flowchart Maker OSF (To host project files) Latex overleaf (To format documents) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
