I’d be interested to see the source on that particular paragraph, which is essentially discrediting an entire field encompassing art therapy, music therapy, and other expressive art therapy modalities.', 'Thank you, it will definitely be helpful.', ""I have slightly modified the language of that paragraph to better communicate the message I initially intended. What it was meant to communicate is that expressive arts therapy careers outside the context of otherwise being licensed to practice psychotherapy are limited, since the person would not be allowed to practice outside of this very narrow scope. There are some locales in the US where one can practice creative arts therapy without being licensed to practice other forms of psychotherapy. Also, yes, there is evidence in favor of creative arts therapy, but, again, this evidence suggests the benefits largely exist for mood disturbances and anxiety and that they are transient (in other words, the benefits last during and for shortly after the activity, but do not necessarily last for long periods after the activity has been completed--much like any recreational activity). Therefore, these therapies are best practiced (and most efficacious when practiced) within the context of other EBTs, such as CBT, rather than as a stand-alone treatment, since the goal of CBT or another EBT would be to teach a *lasting* skill which would provide long-term symptom mitigation. People who can practice expressive arts therapy but not other forms of psychotherapy (in places where that is allowed) are therefore going to find their employment opportunities limited. Licensed psychotherapists who have the fuller scope of practice and are *also* competent in expressive arts therapy will not experience this limitation. That's the original intent of the paragraph--thanks for pointing out that the language was confusing!""]"

Now, it might seem like people who spend a lot of time studying, like clinical psychologists, should earn more money. But here’s the thing, how much someone gets paid isn’t just about how much education they have. It’s more about how their job fits into the bigger picture of the economy, which is what we call macroeconomics.\n\nLet’s use an example: someone who graduates from Harvard with a degree in business or finance. These people often go into jobs where the companies they work for are making lots of money. Because these companies are focused on making profits, they’re willing to pay a lot to get the best workers, which is why people in finance can earn big salaries. The demand for their skills is high, and there aren’t as many people with those specific skills, so the pay goes up.\n\nNow, think about clinical psychologists. They do super important work, helping people with their mental health, but the places they work like hospitals or clinics are often funded by the government. The government has a budget, and it has to spread that money across lots of different things, like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Because of these budget limits, the salaries in healthcare might not be as high as in other fields, even though the work is very specialized and important.\n\nOn the flip side, jobs like truck driving or laborers might pay well even though they don’t require a lot of education. This happens because those jobs are tough, maybe not as many people want to do them, and there’s a strong demand for them. When there’s a lot of demand but not enough people willing to do the work, salaries go up.\n\nSo, when you hear that clinical psychologists might earn between $70,000 and $100,000, it’s because of how their job fits into the overall economy. Even though they study for many years, their pay is influenced by factors like government funding, the demand for mental health services, and how much money is available in the healthcare system.

I think many mental healthcare practitioners also suffer further as they are forced to cut costs if they want to provide services equitable. An admirable goal.

However, I think there’s been a bit of a misunderstanding of what I originally said, so let’s take a closer look.\n\nFirst, you’re absolutely right that there’s high demand for clinical psychologists, and in private practice, they can indeed make a substantial income. Where I was focusing, though, was on clinical psychologists working in hospital settings. While doctors do earn more, the pay for psychologists in these environments is influenced by factors like government funding and budget allocations within the healthcare system. So, while the demand is high, the structure of the funding impacts how much they can earn in those specific settings. Although supply and demand take place, you also have caps that the organization will just do without.  Look at nursing as an example, there are many public institutions that will just go without and just be understaffed, but in the private market, you don't really deal with understaffing, many organizations will try to run with the minimum amount of staff that they can, but they will have who and what they need to make money. \n\nAs for the business degree, I wasn’t talking about business degrees in general, but specifically about graduates from top-tier institutions like Harvard. Yes, business is a popular major, and there are many people with those degrees. But when you’re coming out of a school like Harvard and entering fields like finance, where firms are highly profitable and competing fiercely for top talent, that’s where the salaries really spike. By some establishments, if you graduate from a top teir university with just an undergraduate dagree, you can be making $150,000 out the gate. It’s not about a shortage of degrees but rather the premium placed on the combination of elite education and the profitability of the sector.\n\nSo, while there’s merit to what you’ve said, the bigger picture I was trying to paint is how various factors, like where you work, the industry you’re in, and the economic forces at play, determine salary levels, not just the education or demand for a profession."", 'It depends on who is paying.  People who pay private have no problem getting an appointment.', 'I am not sorry to ""um actually"" back. Mostly because it is fun. \n\nUnderstanding industry salaries across a country falls under macroeconomics. Macroeconomics focuses on the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole, including large-scale factors such as national income, employment rates, and overall salary trends across industries. \n\nMicroeconomics, on the other hand, would deal with salary decisions at the level of individual companies, organizations, and people. \n\nThis conversation was about the rates across the entire Australia.', ""Interesting, because these figures don't reflect the average income for clin psychs in Aus."", 'Yes but again why look at outliers? It’s more reasonable to assume they are average which can be lower I suspect due to how many patients you see, location, experience, psych qualifications etc.', ""That seems reasonable and in line with what I've observed. But the commenter is a clinical psychologists so they are in a far better position to provide insight."", 'This is just not true in Australia. Both the public and private systems are struggling to manage demand.', 'Yes but I think their averages is based off American wages. Not Australian.', 'They should then pay more 🤷🏼\u200d♂️', 'I don’t think so. Almost every website in Australia seems to peg the salary at around $100k to $120k which likely covers NGOs, government, part-time roles and more (those working fewer hours in private). \n\nIf so, I think it’s reasonable to use the median/average salary rather than outliers or the top % statistically to set reasonable expectations. The benefit of psych is the option to go private and make more - however not everyone does so or manages too and that should be taken into consideration.', 'Their median was way off compared to yours! Anyway.. I saw a few in the range of $240k+ but obviously private (like you stated) and 10+ years of experience with complex trauma and adolescence.', 'The range does include around $80k to $140k - I suspect they might be picking up counsellors and social workers. Hence the lower salary - yes but I doubt many psychologist can or will demand that. I’d expect those who own/manage practises or specialise via experience and/or PhD’s do well. \n\nI also wonder if the salary picks up academics. I don’t know that academics in psychology would be paid those mega-salaries unless they are in very senior roles.']"

Most universities only require 3 letters of recommendation, but is it beneficial to have more? I could potentially get 7-9, but I don’t know if that looks cheeky or what not

It’s not a good look. 3 is the limit for a reason and that reason is that the committee does not have the time nor patience to read 7-9 letters for every applicant. Pick the three who you believe would write you the strongest letters of recommendation.\n\nAs for asking, just be upfront and ask.

They may ask for a meeting with you to discuss what information you’d like for them to include in their letter.\n\nGood luck with your application! :)', 'ask the 3 people you feel will give an honest and good letter of recommendation about two months before they’re due. do NOT get 9 letters of recommendation. 3 is overkill for most places\n\ni asked for letters over email because i applied during COVID. you can ask professors after class or send them an email. be prepared to send them a resume and send a summary of the type of work you’d like to do someday', 'There are templates for requesting letters of recommendation if you aren’t quite sure what to say. You don’t have to use those templates exactly but they can give you suggestions for wording. It won’t sound like begging, professors are used to getting asked for letters of recommendation but they also typically want to be able to put their name on a good letter for a good student. So make sure you’re asking professors who you think you have good rapport with, not just casually. Make a list of the deadlines for submitting your apps, or even when you want to start submitting apps and I recommend asking at least a month and a half or two months before you need the letters.

This University is a logistical nightmare, I have had every possible issue, and I have felt like I have been pulling my hair out all summer. The fact that some Alumni have even told me that this is normal is validating and disheartening. 

  
My current issue is I am missing something for medical clearance that I was not told about until last Friday. Got it done and it will take a week at minimum to get the report back, which is when classes start. I have to be medically cleared to attend said classes, when I reached out asking if I will be-their response was ""Okay, thanks""

My brother in Christ, will you temporarily approve me until my report comes in? Do I need to drop my classes? Like that is literally next week. You should also have a note about students who have had the utter joy of having chicken pox TWICE and needing to prove immunity. 

Asked my advisor and haven't heard back. Other side/issue, I started a new job in the public school system and realized that graduate school has a very strict schedule. Only one time slot available, which is fine until it's a 4pm class and students don't get out until 3:46. (which is currently my issue and my advisor told me to just make an accommodation with my prof)

  
SO, do I just give up and try an online University to accommodate my schedule. Do I keep fighting and hope for the best, and prepare for even more logistical issues?

I wish there was a Worldwide Accreditation - or is there? ,bad_hombreh,0,1ew0p74,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1ew0p74/i_wish_there_was_a_worldwide_accreditation_or_is/,2,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out for guidance on pursuing a career in psychology with an international client base. I hold a bachelor's degree in psychology from the USA and am keen to delve deeper into the field.

Currently residing in France, I'm open to relocating to another European country for my master's degree. My primary interest lies in specializing in intercultural and expatriate psychology, with a particular focus on Latin America, the USA, and Western Europe.

I understand that the landscape of psychological practice varies significantly between countries. In the United States, for instance, licensing and accreditation are regulated at the state level, creating a complex patchwork of requirements. In contrast, Europe seems to have more centralized bodies like EuroPsy. Does a world-wide accreditation exist? If not, I don't mind having an European accreditation and working with us clients under the grey area loophole that is ""coaching"", but having my future client's understanding that I indeed went through the proper training to be their therapist. I guess this boils down to the main question: what do I need to legally amd ethically meet the basic requirements to help bia telehalth worldwide?


Given this, I'm curious about the following:
 
 * Are there specific educational paths or certifications that are particularly beneficial for this field? Do you know of programs geared towards multicultural families? (I would like to carry out research correlating ADHD and Third Culture Kids)

 * How does one navigate the complex web of licensing and accreditation requirements when working across borders?

Any insights or experiences you can share would be incredibly helpful. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

It sets a precedent with your clients that you are not concerned with ethical guidelines. \n\nAs for licensing - frankly, it’s difficult. You have to be licensed everywhere your clients would reside. It’s probably easier to focus on clients in one location.

Can a social anxious introvert become a therapist?,Impossible_Demand_62,25,1evayqm,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1evayqm/can_a_social_anxious_introvert_become_a_therapist/,8,"\[MN, USA\] I graduated in 2021 with a BA in Graphic Design, but I feel a very strong pull to go back to college for psychology. I have a lot of doubts/fears though (shocking lol), and I'm not totally sure where to start. I was thinking about taking a psyc class at a community college just to get my feet wet and I'd love to get some volunteering experience within the next year to make sure that this is a path I want to pursue. My therapist has also offered to help put me in touch with graduate program faculty in our area. 

But I have some questions:

1. How important is volunteer/previous school experience when it comes to getting into an MA Counseling program? I have a 3.8 gpa and minored in the honors program at my school, which heavily focused on classic literature, human behavior/psychology, cultural diversity, social justice, and world issues. There was a heavy emphasis on writing (loved this) and some presentations (did not love this lol). I'm also currently volunteering for a cat rescue but so far most of my hours are spent interacting with and helping people. 

2. As far as my personal doubts, I'm nervous that my anxiety and tendency toward social exhaustion may prevent me from getting through school and/or being a good counsellor. I have baggage from complex trauma + severe anxiety/mental illness in my teens, and sometimes I get headaches and zone out during conversations. I'm not sure if this is from anxiety or from focusing so much on how I'm coming across to people (policing my own facial expressions and tone). Thankfully I've made huge strides in regards to healing + reducing my anxiety and I'm absolutely determined to keep at it. I love people and have always been really fascinated with human behavior, forensics, mental illness, body language, relationships, etc. I'm also the advice/emotional support person whenever my friends are going through something, and I've talked multiple people down from suicide. 

3. Any opinions on these schools? Mainly looking at these MA in counseling programs: Saint Mary's University of MN (where I got my BA) and St Thomas. The downside of St Mary's is that the program is apparently not accredited (but meets the education requirements for licensure in MN). However, the majority of the therapists I've worked with, including my current one, have all graduated from there. Both schools are less than 15 min commute.

That said, you need to adequately address your own issues and trauma so that they don’t impact your ability to be present in the therapy session with a client. I am a long-term therapist supervisor and have seen performance anxiety and unaddressed trauma cause issues for therapists. It is entirely possible to address these issues.  Leaving them unaddressed is a potential problem. So, you should set the expectation for yourself to actively engage in your own treatment and to actively use supervision and have heightened awareness of when your own issues are impacting a client’s session.', '1. Volunteer and school work is important, graduate admissions are generally holistic. So this factors in school, GPA, experience etc… \n\n2. You’ll be fine. Therapists at the end of the day are human. They’re not omniscient beings who reached a point of zen once obtaining licensure. Graduate programs in counseling require a lot of reading, writing, and self reflection. These personal doubts can be brought up in your own individual therapy as well. Therapists are also highly encouraged to seek their own personal therapy too\n\n3. My program is also unaccredited and Im in CA. As long as you qualify for licensure in your state, you’re fine. However I was told this by my advisors on the basis that CA has one of the most stringent licensing standards in the country. Regardless, moving will require additional paperwork if you’re going for LMFT, less of LPCC (again based on my advice being in CA, please verify online). Regardless, in the mean time, once you get into the program — save every syllabus for future licensing boards in case you move \n\nHope this helps!', 'Chiming in as a clinical supervisor to reinforce the importance of working through your “baggage”, as you put it. If your dissociation, anxiety, etc are not effectively addressed, those things will impact client care. I’ve supervised student interns, pre-licensed and fully-licensed therapists. Some viewed themselves as competent therapists, and yet were unaware when their reactions during therapy sessions frequently were unhelpful or clinically ineffective. Usually this was rooted in avoidance.\nFor example, one therapist thought it was appropriate to change the subject whenever her patients began to get a little emotionally dysregulated, and then spend the rest of session on neutral topics to “build rapport”. She was unaware this was caused by her own discomfort with painful emotions and resulted in her role-modeling avoidance to her patients. When we attempted to address this in clinical supervision, she was fairly defensive and said as a “highly sensitive person” there was nothing she could do about it. Sigh', '1) Relevant volunteer work is important, yes. As long as you’ve done the necessary pre-requisites, you should be OK academically. \n\n2) It’s easy to say “of course you can do it” and of course you can, but realistically your experience of therapy work will be much harder if you’re prone to exhaustion with social contact. And if you zone out a lot while listening, your clients will eventually pick up on that. I do a lot of therapy work and things that felt manageable in my first few years have become more difficult as the years go on. Be very aware of your needs and aim for a job where you do a little less therapy and maybe a little more administration or other kinds of work. \n\n3) Do not go to a non-accredited program if you can possibly avoid it. Even if it meets education requirements in your state, you will have a hard time working in other states and you will constantly be competing for jobs with applicants from accredited programs. I do a lot of hiring for clinical staff and we never even consider applicants from non-accredited programs, as they consistently struggle with the work.

Does the “how they treating you is how they feel about you” apply to parent-child dynamics as well? ,someoneoutthere1335,4,1evf47l,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1evf47l/does_the_how_they_treating_you_is_how_they_feel/,5,"I’ve been wondering about this for a while now. Does this thing apply to parents when it comes to their children? Like, a parent being condescending, @busive, overly judgmental and demanding, bringing you down, sabotage you, trying to dim your light or whatever… Does it mean that they feel this bad about you? Cuz you know, if a woman makes negative comments about another women there’s usually this underlying negative perception going on … jealousy, admiration, maybe the typical “why you and not me” … is something like this true when it comes to how parents view their children as well?

Cuz a man b* eating up his woman isn’t love … how is it then parental love when d0 mestic @ buse takes place? When the child has dreams and all the parent does is shut them down? I believe just like not every human can love right, not every parent can love right either … 
It’s an unfortunate reality for example with narcissistic parents, you will never truly know whether they love you or not … and it’s not “yeah they do love you but they have a weird personality/way of expressing it” … No … sometimes people don’t love … sometimes the parent doesn’t think of anyone else other than themselves .. and it’s for sure not a given that your parents love you unconditionally …

How do you treat someone you love?

MS in Counseling 

Clinical Psych PHD

Counseling PsyD

Nursing-PMHNP Masters

Med School

etc

I initially thought about school psychology, but after working in an American school, I changed my mind about that. Also I'm a huge night owl. Given the choice, I naturally wake up about 11am. I've tried to force myself to wake up early and it never sticks. Obviously I did in when I was in school, but I had no choice. I think it negatively affected me even back then. One of the things that appeals to me about being a therapist is that I've heard you can set your own schedule. I also like talking to people and teaching. I really like having 1 on 1 classes. Helping people would be nice. And I really prefer to have autonomy in my work. 

How can I decide which one is right for me? Is there any in particular you would recommend or advise against? Being almost done with my 20s, I'm feeling a lot of pressure to decide on something. But just trying to google these hasn't really helped me move closer to a decision.

Then you get your clinical hours to get full licensure for any of the three licenses. \n\nIf you want to go the LPC route, often times those programs are called Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Make sure it’s CACREP accredited. \n\nIf you go MFT, you gotta get a masters in marriage & family therapy, accredited by COAMFTE. MFT is the least common licensure, unless you’re in California. \n\nIf your end goal is to be a therapist, ask yourself what kind of training you want, what populations, what type of therapy you want to do? Big questions tho that often you may not know the answer to initially. Do you want to make more money than the average therapist? It’ll cost ya but a Clinical Psychologist or Psychiatrist would do the trick, Especially psychiatrist. But many psychiatrists don’t even do therapy, primarily. If your goal is to get licensed as fast as you can, I’d recommend Social Work bachelor followed by an accelerated social work masters program. But, you’ll get objectively less training to be a therapist than others, honestly, because a Masters in social work teaches you to do non therapy social work as well. \n\nIf you want more only-therapist training, go LPC.  If you’re interested in systems, like wanting to work with families or couples, go MFT. Both LPC, MFT, and Social Work can provide individual and systems work, but each gives you a different kind of training and theoretical orientation. \n\nHope this helps - if I got anything wrong, anybody reading, please correct me. This is from my understanding as a current MFT student in Ohio.', 'If you have a masters that licenses I imagine it wouldn’t be an issue. The bigger issue in my mind would be applying to grad programs. Many programs require a bachelor’s in a related field (ie social work, psychology, humanities even). What you would need to do is research grad programs and look at their requirements. Some only require you have taken prerequisite courses which you can do no matter the major. But some would require a specific major or at least a related major.', ""I feel like you can do more without a bachelor in psych, especially because you went with a bachelor's in business. You could do marketing, PR and counseling. I think you are more hireable as a administrator, a counselor if you get licensed or you go the advertising, HR, marketing research route. I think you have given yourself more wiggle room if you find the right employer."", 'It depends on where, but then you’d probably need a masters in psychology or a PsyD/PhD. If you are in business, in theory you could probably get into a PsyD and then pursue industrial/organizational psychology but a PsyD is like usually about 200k or 300k USD and you need to look at your local accreditation board for therapists as their education requirements might be different', ""are you going to a 4 year school that is solely intended for those wanting a degree in business (I.e. business school)? If not and you're attending a regular 4 year university, you can change your major. Just because you declare a major when you applied, does not mean you have to see it through. \n\nJust to reiterate what everybody else has said, you can get into a therapy masters program with any undergrad degree. For example, I am in a masters program for marriage & family therapy and few people in my cohort have a business degree, one with an undergrad degree in journalism, and one with a degree in nursing. So really as long as you have the specific things that the programs require, it doesn't matter what degree you are entering with."", 'Your bachelors won’t matter if you have a PhD.', 'I did business undergrad, hated it, went back to college to complete some required classes and applied for my masters in counseling. I’m now a therapist working in private practice!', 'If you just want to be a therapist though, a masters in counseling or social work is sufficient.', 'Correct. You can go sociology bachelors to social work masters. Social work bachelors to an accelerated MSW. Sociology to and MFT program. I think there are a few combinations but I don’t think you can go from environmental science to social work/ MFT', 'Realistically no masters level degree gives anyone enough training to be a therapist. Any masters-level clinician should be doing lots of training after grad school.', 'Yes I’m in the US! This was super insightful thank you! I personally am ok with spending more time in school, but I wasn’t aware of the different options and programs- will definitely do more research when applying esp in relation to possible pre reqs!', ""I'm interested in MFT, any reason why it's the least common licensure?"", 'My MSW program was mostly career changers. Generally masters degrees are.', 'I agree with this. I wouldn’t do a bachelors in psych, rather do something that makes you more marketable altogether or can help you down the line to do private practice, as that requires knowledge and experience in marketing  and business, something many therapists do not have but need.', 'Oh I totally see what you mean- I wasn’t planning on doing bachelor in psych simply bec I have way too many credits done for business already- but I do find this opinion comforting! Thank you', 'You can go from pretty much anything to social work and MFT', 'I completely agree with you. 100%.', 'Often times, the pre reqs for counseling masters programs will be one or two psych undergrad courses (such as abnormal psych & developmental psych) and maybe a biology class. Moooost LSW, LPC, LMFT grad programs don’t require any pre-reqs. A masters in psychology though, that may be different. \n\nJust know that above all, honestly, your undergrad doesn’t matter super much if your end goal is to be a therapist. At the most, it could save you a year of graduate school - so that right there may be incentive enough to choose a certain bachelors program. But even then, that’s mostly for Social Work. I’m not aware of many CMHC accelerated programs. If you go MFT, good luck on that. It’ll be at least two years, because of the specific systems focus. I don’t mind tho, personally, as an MFT student, with spending two years. That is, besides having to take out more loans. \n\nBut also - just know - a masters degree in psych doesn’t do anything, for the most part, by itself. If you go strictly psychology, you have to get a PhD or Doctorate to do what you want to do. But if you’re willing to stick it out, you can make much more money than the average therapist. Just keep in mind you’ll have to do a lot of research in grad school. \n\nIf you love medical stuff and want to go into psychiatry, you’ll make BANK. We are intensely lacking in psychiatrists in the US, especially adolescent and child psychiatrists. Could make 300 to 400k dollars.', 'It’s newer compared to the others, and there are less graduate programs for it because of that. Also, some think you can’t work with individuals if you’re an MFT, but you can. I recommend the MFT route especially if you’re interested in relationship counseling or marriage counseling and/or family counseling. Or, if you plan to work with adolescents. Systems Theory is essential when working with adolescents, namely if there’s any type of conflict in the family (and often there is, even if the parents try and scapegoat the child)', 'Yes social work is generally better suited towards a variety of backgrounds. Clinical Mental Health programs and doctorate programs in psychology tend to be looking for students with a background in psychology.\n\nJust something to consider when looking at programs. See what each of their requirements are.', 'I definitely read your original post too fast and thought you were contemplating changing your undergrad. A business undergrad degree is an amazing bachelors to have if you want to be a therapist eventually, because you’ll have much greater ease with running a private practice, or being a clinical director of an organization, or the CEO of a treatment program, etc. you’ve got a leg up with administrative stuff, which increases your access to helping more people and can give you more influence (and money). \n\nMost graduate school programs for counseling or psych won’t care that you don’t have a psych undergrad. They’ll gladly accept you']"

Best of luck to you and remember to have fun in the process.', 'I got into all grad programs I applied to, so here\'s my advice:\n\n1st year: Focus on your classes. Get a good grasp of handling and managing grades. This will give you a strong basis for upper years, when you start exploring anything extra. If you can, getting familiar with reading academic articles will be helpful.\n\n2nd year: Your classes will be more in depth, so start talking to professors that interest you. Search their names on google scholar or researchgate, read their papers. Talk to them about their research and volunteering opportunities etc. I advise making rapport first through asking questions & going to office hours first before mentioning lab opportunities.\n\nThird year: Start exploring paid opportunities. I did part time research assistant, daycare supply teaching, and ABA therapy for kids with Autism throughout my undergrad (because I\'m in developmental). Various paid experiences will really make you stand out. Volunteering in more than one lab should also help, if working is too much (or getting a more important role in one lab is good too, it\'s really about what u can get in your circumstance, that aligns with your interest). Start emailing professors for undergrad honours thesis supervision.\n\n4th year: Focus on your thesis project if you have one. If not, try if you can get an important role in any project and participate in writing a manuscript. Start asking professors for recommendation letters & work on your grad apps.\n\nAll throughout undergrad: Your GPA is your basis, anything extra is only meaningful if you are a good academic. Always know your ""why"". Psych is very competitive, but you must be internally motivated to be a good psychologist. Explore questions and enjoy deep contemplations and conversations. Please focus on what\'s really meaningful, rather than what will look good on your resume. That is the only way for you to really stand out anyways.', 'You should focus on your degree and if you actually like psychology! Try to form genuine connections with 1 or 2 professors if you like them because of their class/research. \n\nPersonally I wouldn’t worry about grad school yet, there will be time for that. Enjoy your classes, get to know your professors, join research labs if you can. Maybe you’ll really like it and grad school will be the next step, but maybe it won’t be (esp a PhD), either way it’s okay. You don’t need to make that decision now- you haven’t even had any classes yet. As long as you’re trying your best and following your passion for psych by engaging in it academically, that’s the best next step.', 'I want to build in this. Your first year, you are going to learn foundations for everything.  You will have a lot of crossover as well. The math you learn your first year will help with your research class in you masters.

Is this something to just get over despite my diagnosis?

I went to two days of my psychology, doctorate orientation, and felt very overstimulated and overwhelmed. The people didn’t feel very nice, and the atmosphere felt very overstimulating; like I wouldn’t be able to focus on academia. 

It’s also a long drive to get there every day, and I would have to wake up very very early. Since I can’t focus, I feel like I’m just gonna be burnt out, and I have to study when I’m finally home and relearn concepts by myself. 

I am thinking of doing online school instead, but my parents are very mad, and are telling me I’m being too weak and to tough it out. As a matter of fact, my mom is saying she doesn’t even believe in my diagnosis. She also thinks I’m playing the victim card. Has Autism Limited you from things like this? Am I just being “weak” like my mother says? It’s all getting to me and I don’t even know what to believe anymore which is why I’d like to hear some of y’all’s opinions.

I had mixed feelings about it. Online classes are definitely more chill and comfortable, but for us they were mostly in the evenings which was tiring. They also were generally taught by adjuncts who were busy and stressed and not focused on teaching which was somewhat demoralizing. Personally, I like being on campus because it puts me in “work mode” but it absolutely can be distracting. The only things I would say you miss out on by being online is building rapport with your cohort and more hands on/practical skills, if that’s something the class involves. Good professors can use online tools very effectively though. If it’s a program designed for online, rather than professors who have been recently forced online, the online experience will probably be better. And if you don’t get along with your cohort, the rapport part might not matter so much. I’m really sorry you haven’t had a good experience with them, I’ve found my cohort to be a great resource but I know that is not the norm in many doctorate programs :(\n\nDoes your program have a practicum/shadowing element? That was the activity I found the most benefit from being in person, it’s really great being able to watch a professional work in context and learn from observing. If an online program still has opportunities for doing things like that in person, I think your learning shouldn’t be negatively impacted by not being fully in person for lectures and such', 'Well, thats true.

Many, e.g. California, make no mention of APA-accreditation in their licensure requirements. Then there is a group I the middle who will accept degrees from APA-accredited program or an equivalent. Equivalency is determined by each state’s respectively licensing board. An applicant may be required to submit additional documentation (course catalogs, syllabi, etc.) with their application to establish equivalency. As long as your program meets the requirements of that state, you’re good to go. State-level differences can include required coursework, required pre-post doc training hours, passing EPPP scores, etc. some states require a 2k-hour internship, others require fewer hours. Some states require a course on group work. Others do not. In any case, it is very possible to obtain a license in many states without an APA-accredited degree, so long as you meet a given state’s other requirements.\n\nEdit: I overlooked OP’s note that they are applying to masters programs. A few states have a license for master’s-level psychologists. Many require a doctoral degree. I have less information about this, as my state requires a doctoral degree.

Im a 2nd year psych student thinking about getting some good and solid work experience as soon as possible, so applying for future jobs/ masters programmes may be slightly simpler. 
I have some solid volunteering already, but i doubt this will be very relevant by the time I finish my undergrad considering it was done in my 6th year of highschool.

Relationship between fantasising and cognitive distortion?,idiot-with-wifi,2,1euqhr0,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1euqhr0/relationship_between_fantasising_and_cognitive/,4,"Hi! I'm currently writing a personal essay about fantasising, and how it leaves me often disappointed in reality. 

I quickly want to touch on the possibility of cognitive distortion related to fantasising. I imagine that fantasising often, especially to comfort oneself, can lead to the normalisation/expectation of a parasocial relationship for example.

I've looked at research relating to cognitive distortion in sex offenders, and while it does mention fantasizing, they do not elaborate on the link between the two. And while I can find research about cognitive distortion in relation to porn consumption, I can't find anything about sexual fantasies in general.

Does anybody know more about the relationship between fantasising and cognitive distortion? For example, can fantasising reinforce cognitive distortions? Any information on the topic is welcome!

Almost always they have some trauma. Something about trauma breaks a person’s brain, fantasy is a comfort for the difficult realities around them. And then the fantasy (when it’s all they have) it becomes a part of their reality too which is cognitive distortion right. Maybe, idk.\nI think sex offenders maybe is another topic, because a lot have personality disorders like within cluster b usually somewhere around ASPD or NPD and they lack empathy, manipulative. I feel people with cognitive distortions are probably more at risk usually to sex offenders rather than the offender suffering from the distortions themselves.  I mean both predators and victims could have cognitive distortions I just think maybe the distortions themselves wouldn’t be the cause of violence, that’s more the general lack of empathy.', 'I would advice to read some important articles around fantasising and cogntive distortion.

Why are you letting this one thing deter you from studying psychology all together.', 'Psychology is almost as competitive as medical school because basically every girl does psych. Masters are challenging, PsyD will cost like $200k USD, PhD are competitive and need masters which can be very competitive and expensive in America like 50 or 60k USD. And the job is very challenging and emotionally draining, people will probably yell at you in clinical psych. A lot of people you can’t help, some people will kill themselves. I went to a psych ward and some lady was fighting with the drs, like uh physically fighting. If you are having second thoughts then that means something, I never had second thoughts, the only second thought I ever had was very early on and it was based around just not being smart enough for a PhD but I didn’t realize I could just do a masters or even a PsyD one day, but masters are still incredibly competitive. I think psych is good for you if it’s your life, without psych I’m probably gonna jump off a bridge and die. Your career needs to be an extension of yourself, are you fixing yourself? I think the best mental health workers are people who try to fix themselves, because that’ll give them passion to help others too. Tbh, I saw some guy on a bridge the other day while I was driving. I pulled over walked up and asked him if he needed help (because he was slunched like he was considering jumping). He was very rude and basically said no and go away, but then at least he started walking away from the bridge. I mean he wasn’t very nice to me, but I think maybe deep down me asking if he was okay at least helped him a little because his dumbass at least moved from the bridge. Helping crazy people is not easy and they are mean. I think for me, helping people is a way to focus off of my own mental issues. It’s not easy but there are easier forms of therapy, like maybe be a sex counsellor or idk. There are other paths instead of therapy too, maybe like a speech pathologist or teacher. Second thoughts are there for a reason, mine have always been just about not being smart enough, but worst case I can be a social worker or etc. It’s a long road but this is my life, without it I’ll probably die so.\n\n*Psych has a lot of pathways from undergrad. If you just like learning about psych you could always pursue research type work and then get into psychology teaching (like a professor after masters & PhD). You could get into corporate, hr, etc. Therapy so like a psychologist or psychotherapist/LPCC (masters). Psychiatry you should do biomed maybe with a psych minor because you need to go to medical school and then after specialize in psychiatry. If you are interested more in neuro then maybe psychiatry is better, you still get crazy people yelling at you but your job would be more to just assess and prescribe but there is still a large social component, I’ve always been diagnosed by psychiatrists and so they have had to sit and speak with me one on one over the course of multiple sessions which still requires people skills and traditional therapy techniques.\n\n*Also, the suicide rate for physicians is pretty high. A lot of doctors kill themselves compared to the general population, idk why but just keep this in mind. I think with psychologists and psychiatrists it’s influenced a lot by the things they see at work, same with medical doctors. A lot of pain and these are hard jobs which require a lot of stressful and competitive (expensive too) schooling.', ""Aside from your doubts, what you're saying is quite ableist and frankly appalling."", ""Yes, I have experienced this. I used to be very empathetic and non - judgemental as a teen. Believing in all the liberal values , etc. So I wanted to study psychology to become a psychotherapist. \n\nNow as an adult in college I'm conservative and judge people a LOT. I believe in judging others for their actions and it's just really difficult to empathize with people whom you can't stand. I'm anything but empathetic anymore. \n\nSo I regret getting into psychology. \n\nHow did I overcome this? I love children. I can definitely work with kids at a school setting, be an educational/school psychologist instead of working with adults as a therapist. \n\nSee the thing about psychology is that you can work with any population. Legal, health, educational, it's your choice what setting you wanna work with. You don't have to work with people with disabilities. \n\nYou could become a researcher, a writer, a HS teacher (who teaches psychology) a school counselor, drug/substance abuse, social worker, anything! \n\nThis field is vast. I don't think anyone could regret getting this degree (other than the fact that you'll have to get a masters) ."", 'in my country psychology is not very strict, anyone with a psychology degree can do anything like therapy as working on labs, normally they only work in school with kids.', 'It’s not ableist to not want to dedicate your life towards working with a population you simply don’t want to work with. Ultimately, OP vocalizing and seeking advice about changing career paths/specialized fields ensures that they aren’t taking a job/role away from someone better suited to provide any specific population compassionate and genuine care.', 'It is not ableist to not want to work with autistic people as an undergrad. Especially considering the fact that people going after ABA work are people with a basic Bachelor’s degree in psych who don’t have the specialized training (aside from an RBT license) that I feel should be required to work with autistic people. I absolutely abhor the fact that people with a BA can’t do most forms of counseling because they don’t “have enough schooling” but for autism you barely need anything. 40 hours of training for RBT? Absolutely not enough considering every case of autism is different and children each have different needs. I interviewed for a few ABA positions and they all told me I’d have around 6 hours of training under a master’s student and then I’d be on my own. So, to me that reads like “you don’t have enough schooling to touch mental health counseling, but you can risk fucking up an autistic kid because we care less about them”. THAT to me feels ableist. Add to that the low pay and high turnover for these companies. Kids with autism deserve WAY better programs than some rando coming into the house every few months because of turnover. \n\nLots of people aren’t equipped to deal with autism, and that’s okay, and if I were a parent I would prefer someone with more than basic schooling.', 'Seconding this, and I want to add that while ABA/RBT is an extremely common source of related experience for undergraduates it’s certainly not the end all be all and with growing controversy surrounding ABA and its focus on behavior and lack of focus on the clients personal wants and needs, I can only be very concerned for clients that OP works with. \n\nNot to detract from how taxing, physically demanding, and sometimes alarming it can be but if anyone feels overwhelmingly negative about any work they do with vulnerable populations they should remove themselves from it.', 'That doesn’t answer why you think you can’t work with non-autistic people', 'Agreed, and OP sounds young. However, OP can\'t quite articulate why they are so afraid of working with autistic populations. Based on their comments in this thread it sounds like they want to vent their emotions about autism more than have a productive conversation, but doesn\'t recognize this emotion. OP is seeking a career in dealing with other peoples\' emotional complexities and difficulties in communicating, but doesnt realize that this is what they\'re facing with autism, too.\n\nQuite honestly, when you do your internship/training for any career in healthcare, you are free labor and will be dealing with the less ""desirable"" cases. If you wanted to become a RN, you will probably be cleaning up peoples\' feces and vomit in a hospital for at least part of your training. If you really want this career, you tough it out through grad school, and you learn a lot from the experience.\n\nOP you might want to get some experience before going into grad school and make sure this is what you really want, and I\'m not talking about autistic populations. A textbook makes things like schizophrenia, BPD, and ASPD sound *so* fascinating, but in the end they\'re people, and people are more than a set of interesting symptoms on a paper. If you think autism is difficult to work with, you are in for a real surprise with actual mental illnesses.', 'oh it’s the opposite, i do think i can work with non autistic people, but my last 3 years of high school i was on a special school with the majority of students being autistic, i really didn’t have any problem with any of them and actually had a few friends who were on a high level of autism, autistic people are a bit fragile and i don’t want to make a mistake and potentially giving them trauma\n\ni know that can happen with non autistic people too but i feel like the damage is bigger when is the other way around.', 'I applaud this take, I absolutely agree with the concern regarding not being able to properly communicate their thoughts/feelings as it does seem very counterproductive for the field OP is considering. Taking demographic and population out of the question, anyone in mental health/behavioral health/psychology needs to be willing to learn and able to communicate and interact with others in a therapeutic manner.', 'I guess I’m not understanding your concern here. Like, if you’re that worried about traumatizing a certain population, just don’t work with them?', 'I‘m working towards my license as a therapist and what I can tell from other colleagues is that it‘s normal to have populations you don‘t work with - because you don‘t feel competent or specialized enough or also because you simply don‘t like working with them for personal reasons. I found my niche with both victims and offenders of child sexual abuse and a lot of therapists refer them out. Meanwhile I usually refer out patients with schizophrenia and my supervisor refers out patients with eating disorders. You don‘t need to work with people on the spectrum, if you don‘t want to.', 'I think OP just wants to vent about his frustrations with autism.

You are not certain what you would like to specalize, but the beauty in this uncertainty is that just because you do not know what you would like to speacliize in  today, does not mean that tomorrow you will figure it out. \n\nYou can only figure it out by meeting more psyc students, going to office hours and listening to your professors who are psychologist or studied psychology, and learn as much as you can from them. \n\nThe more people you meet, the more you are able to grow. If you do not know where you are going with your degree today, then you will only find that place by gaining life experiences. You gain experiences by connecting with others. For example, how\'s your Linkedin profile? Have you opened an account and connected or at least followed, grad schools that as of now, center around your interest. \n\nHypotheical example. Let\'s say the University of Michigan specalizes in Photography Psychology (BARE WITH ME PLEASE, I have run out of parables and examples for now, actually this is a real thing), you do not have an interest in it, nor know anything about photography psychology. However you made a connection with someone who does do this. You learn from them. \n\nThey share details of their experiences; which means their experience eventually influences you. \n\nNow you do not want to specalize in this, but you have an interest in it. Because of that, you take what you learn from that and build upon it. \n\nIn your post you say you are interested in stressed-focused and research. See if any professors in psyc at your university have this. Reach out to them. You never know what is out there unless you ask. Ask them if you could shadow them in research, or if there is research experience available for undergraduate students. Build your experiences by putting yourself out there for what your interest is in life. \n\nOne thing I have learned in this lifetime is when you are super interested in the same passion as someone else, you may find an opportuntity in that.  But how will they know that if you never connected with them? Which means you need to get out of your comfort zone if you would like to step out and find your ""life calling."" \n\nTake serious note of your advisors advice. Do not overwork yourself to learn this right now, if you could learn it yourself. \n\nOn your free time or summer break, is ""**neurobiology class and was thinking of taking a population genetics class**"" something that you would study and do research outside of the classroom? \n\nSince this course is rigorous, your advisor is hinting to you indirectly that you do not need to work that hard to learn the material as of now. At least, do your own research and see, if this is something you would like to do later down the line. \n\nDo your individual research on neurobiology and population genetics and research the *history of these subjects.* That way you will know during grad school if those are something you would like to do. \n\nYour advisor is hinting to you indirectly that you do not need to do everything now. But what you do need to do, is put yourself out there. Meet with people outside of your interest, even if it is in the same field of psychology. So you can gather more ideas and learn and grow from others. To eventually find out where it is you will like to be at in  life. \n\nYou never know that starting off in college. But one thing I learned about many people in college is that they never end up, where they thought they would end up, but found their passions or ""life callings"" through life experiences.

But I had no awarneess of a fresh local produce store that is in my small town. \n\nThen because I talked to my neighbor, I figured this out. \n\nFiguring this out means I am able to figure out, what is beyond my horizons and current experiences. \n\nThe more you connect with others and do your own research, the closer you will get to finding it is; excactly what you would like to do in life. \n\nIf you have not done so already.

[USA] MSW or PsyD for grad school?,ResponsibleAd4395,4,1etx3x5,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1etx3x5/usa_msw_or_psyd_for_grad_school/,5,"\[USA\]

Hi there,

I graduated in December with my bachelor's in psychology. I've been working as a phlebotomist for the past few months and it has made me realize that I really miss psychology, and I am looking to get started in the field soon. However, I am having a hard time deciding between an MSW and a PsyD. I am leaning towards a MSW, but will lay out my thought process below.

I love psychology and worked in a clinical psychology lab during undergrad, which solidified my interest in helping people heal in a therapeutic setting. My main worry with the MSW is that I will have regretted not going all the way for the doctorate, since I think I have the experience and GPA to have a chance of getting in. I also did some training in assessments during undergrad and enjoyed doing them. The main reason I have strayed away from the idea of the PsyD is I feel I am not ready at this point in my life. I love to travel and also do photography on the side, so I would be hesitant to give up this part of my life and make such a large commitment right now. It is also a huge financial decision, so I want to be sure it is really what I want to do. I listed out some pros and cons I thought of below.

MSW

Pros:

* Broad and flexible degree. The idea of working remote is appealing to me.
* Could pivot to a more macro role if I am experiencing burnout from being a therapist
* 2 year, flexible and accommodating program
* could be perfect to see if the therapist role is for me

Cons:

* Make less money than a PsyD
* Cannot perform assessments
* potentially less ""respect"" in a professional sense

PsyD

Pros:

* can perform assessments
* greater salary
* potentially gain a more thorough education
* more ""respected""
* feel like I ""used"" my experiences accumulated through undergrad

Cons:

* huge time commitment
* uncertainty about the emotional toll of being a therapist
* very specific degree
* very expensive
* less time to travel/pursue other passions

I made these lists based on assumptions so feel free to correct anything! Thank you in advance for your help.",1723835110.0,4,0,Advice/Career,"['To be frank from what you’ve written here it doesn’t sound like you have a specific enough interest in research strong enough to warrant the pursuit of a doctoral degree. \n\nIf respect is a key factor in your desire to pursue a doctoral degree, it’s probably not for you. This isn’t a slight, it’s just the truth. \n\nThe pros you listed for the PsyD are quite generic and I’m not sure you’d be able to articulate your interest well enough to have a compelling application.\n\nNow it’s entirely possible that you made a generic post and didn’t expand for the sake of brevity and if that’s the case you can completely disregard my comment. \n\nIt does sound more like the MSW is of genuine interest to you barring money and respect.', ""I dunno, lemme rephrase the questions here for you:\n\nDo what I like and not make the most income\n\nDo what I don't care for and possibly be miserable\n\n\n\nThat's how it reads."", 'LCSW here. I make the same in PP as many of my Psychologist colleagues, if not more. At the beginning of my career I had some insecurities about “respect,” too. But I realized pretty quickly that if you get intensive training and are good at your job, no one cares. The stigma comes because many LCSWs have appallingly little formal training, but you can get that yourself after school. In my experience, I’ve found that this field is actually pretty merit based. If you’re good at what you do, people don’t care what degree you have. Most of my friends and colleagues are psychologists and they have never made me feel less than.', 'PsyDs are super expensive and don’t always land you the better job - you’ll be competing with clinical PhDs, who are often assumed to be better-prepared, and MSWs, who are cheaper to hire.\n\nIf I couldn’t do a PhD program I’d do the MSW in a heartbeat.', 'Seconding this. OP, you need to really consider why doing a doctorate is so important to you. The ""respect"" piece really isn\'t true - there\'s so many social workers out there I respect equally as much as the doctors, and that has nothing to do with their credentials and everything to do with who they are as people. If you\'re worried about clients potentially not respecting you, that\'s also not true - Clients respect the people who are there to help them genuinely, not your credentials. \n\nOne advice that really sticks with me is that no matter what pathway you take, there\'s going to be both benefits and challenges. While the MSW pathway does indeed not allow you to conduct assessments, it\'s a much more flexible pathway compared to a PsyD alongside being way cheaper and allowing you to practice sooner.']"

Masters fees differ quite a lot between universities, and have also been going up quite steeply in recent years. In 3 or 4 years a masters at a highly ranked uni could be the best part of £20k. And some universities are in financial trouble, which could mean a few closures of low and mid-ranked unis by then, and perhaps fee hikes elsewhere to make up for the decrease in international students. It\'s quite a volatile time. But if you family are well off, or you have a lot of savings built up (e.g. investing childhood gifts from grandparents), this might not be such a worry. Getting BPS accreditation in a first degree would be more cost effective.\n\nBut you may want to work in other fields for a while first to get life experience (a good idea for therapists and counsellors, to understand the world and people\'s behaviour as an adult in other contexts).

I’m 23 years old in south GA, and have 23 more credit hours until my BS in Psychology is completed. I grew up in a toxic environment and had absolutely no guidance or knew anything about college.

Why is schizotypal a personality disorder?,charmingparmcam,2,1esm9nc,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1esm9nc/why_is_schizotypal_a_personality_disorder/,9,"Because then by that logic, why wouldn't persecutory delusions be a PD? There are patterns to everything, and mood disorders also affect interpersonal functioning, how you can view others, and stuff like that. What makes StPD a personality disorder?",1723696079.0,2,0,Discussion,"['So this is an argument in the field. There is some push to conceptualize Schizophrenia as Schizophrenia I and II, in the same way as Bipolar Disorder, in which Schizotypal is considered a ‘Lighter’ version of schizophrenia. To get to the real etiology of it a look at the history is helpful.\n\nSo back in the day (pre-DSM-III), Schizotypal was actually known as Borderline PD. The Borderline term referred to a “borderline psychosis,” but in time the term began to be applied to persons with persecutory ideas of reference but thier predominant trait was mood lability and splitting. So the field separated Schizotypal and Borderline into separate categories. Schizotypal was initially thought to be highly related to schizophrenia, but this link was argued to be conceptual, yet not proven.\n\nSo, anyway, why do we call anything a personality disorder? Because its cross-domain, considered to be stable, emerges as a result of early-period experiences yet manifesting symptoms in adolescence/you g adulthood, and is pervasive throughout the lifespan. If you’ve ever met someone with schizotypal, they don’t necessarily present with the full blown persecutory delusions, or even a robust delusional system. What they do present with is these oddities in behavior, this discomfort with intimacy, this difficult understanding the thought process of others, and this magical strange thought process. It’s not quite psychotic because it’s not so localized just to the topic of the delusions, and it’s not so odd or unusual as far as delusional content. It just feels different to talk to people with this disorder than it does to talk to a person with a psychosis. Not to mention, many people with psychosis - on the right antipsychotics, are fairly normal people. With SPD, medications do not do much to attenuate the social deficits.', 'OP, IllegalBeagleLeague has given you some great and in-depth answers. I will add a more pointed response in addition to their contribution. The DSM is fraught with problems with validity and reliability, and the non-specific quality of many mental health symptoms leads to somewhat perplexing conclusions as to why this is Disorder A, and this seemingly similar thing is Disorder B. The reality is that there is very weak empirical evidence for the diagnostic validity of most of the personality disorders; many are an artifact of previous DSM and have not been scrutinized enough (yet) to be removed, incorporated into other diagnoses, or set aside for dimensional constructs to replace them. The exceptions to this rule are borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, which have stronger validity and reliability but are still not perfect. For more reading on this topic that is easily digestible, I suggest ""The Intelligent Clinician\'s Guide to the DSM-5"" by Joel Paris.', ""But despite those patterns, that creates an argument of anything really being a PD. Even if it's not psychotic, why should it be a PD because it has odd patterns? Depression has patterns, isn't psychotic, yet isn't a PD. Why is schizotypal different?"", 'But all of psychology can be boiled down to ‘odd patterns.’ That is a bit sophistic, to say that every disorder contains “odd patterns of behavior” and therefore one is taxonic (i.e. legitimately exists in nature and is not just label we humans made up) and the other is not. Every disorder contains standard impairment criteria (e.g., impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning) yet we do not use this commonality to support the argument that every disorder is the same and shouldn’t be considered different.\n\nAdditionally, you are missing the three conditions which separate out a personality disorder from depression. Let’s go through them and compare them to depression, since that’s your chosen comparison - it’s a good one!:\n\n1. Emerges in adolescence and based on early life experiences: Schizotypal people display symptoms early in adolescence. Even if undiagnosed until adulthood, you should be able to find signs of these symptoms further back. There should not be someone who is not Schizotypal in young adulthood who, say, in thier 40s, develops Schizotypal. Meanwhile you can be depressed as a child. You can be depressed as a teenager. You can be depressed as an adult. You can be depressed when you’re in your 80s. And each time it could be brand new, like you had no prior history of depression.\n\n2. Stable. Depression, even unmedicated depression, is going to come and go. It’s episodic. You’re going to have periods where you aren’t depressed and some really long ones where you are depressed. But during those periods where you’re not depressed, your symptoms are going to wane. With a PD your symptoms never have period where they go away. There is no ebbing and flowing. They are stable throughout the lifespan.\n\n3. Cross-domain. So let’s look at Depression. Does it have social deficits? sure. Due to avolition, low energy, and other symptoms people with depression have impairments in thier social relationship. However when their symptoms lessen, sometimes naturally and sometimes due to medication+therapy, thier social functioning should go back to normal. It’s not as if they lack the capacity to understand how a social relationship works, and this is especially true when thier symptoms wane with time. With SPD you can expect rigid social deficits throughout the life span. And this lack of understanding affects pretty much every aspect of this person’s life - working is hard, education is difficult, romantic relationships are strained if they exist at all. This is what is meant by acute and pervasive.\n\nAgain as per the first post, can you disagree SPD is a personality disorder? sure. There’s some support in the research for that. But the field as a whole went the other way and has not removed SPD from the personality disorders despite two new versions and revisions to the DSM. These stable, pervasive, lifelong patterns to SPD are why.', ""'Personality disorders' are one of the greatest delusions of modern psychology, you shouldn't expect their assignment to follow any logic. 'Disorders' like bpd NPD schizoid ASPD psychopathy OCPD etc. are simply personality types. There is therefore no such thing as someone who has no PDs, there is no 'normal' or non-personality disordered brain to compare them to.\n\nI suggest you look to the MBTI/Jungian personality models and cross reference each type with the different disorders in the DSM to help you gain a greater understanding of human psychology. Just like many psychologists thought and (probably still do) that being gay was a mental illness, and crazy people were possessed by the devil, the current iteration of psychology is plagued by outdated magical thinking."", 'Thank you for the in-depth and articulate answer here. I’m currently working on my bachelor’s with an intent on going into counseling. Do you have any recommendations on reading materials or further forms of education?', ""So its basically the fact that PDs don't hold that much away unless they're so problematic that it's requiring you to get help?"", 'Thank you very much! You’ll get a ton of information on this stuff the further you get into graduate school. A lot of my information from Schizotypal PD came because I did a research essay on it for a course, specifically because it was a disorder I did not understand well. Later, on internship, I worked therapeutically and in competency restoration with two people who had it. So, I would suggest the farther that you go that if there are disorders you do not understand fully, try to make those the topics you use school assignments to better understand.\n\nBut that is really a suggestion for future you. If you want resources in the here and now, I do have a couple. First, the Intelligent Clinician’s Guide to the DSM-5 by Joel Paris was suggested by Glum_Potential_2050. I haven’t read that but I have read A Concise Guide to Personality Disorders, also by Joel Paris, which was excellent. Additionally , the Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, edited by Oliver John and Richard Robins is an excellent foundational text on personality theory which is a great foundation for counseling work. Both (or all three) can be found on most university libraries or in the right places if you know where to look [*cough, cough*](https://libgen.is)', ""Its more like the labels for PD's are arbitrary. Psychologists just make it up as they go. But I guess the reasoning in this case is that schizotypal personality is permanent. Whereas depression can be temporary (although for many it's permanent anyway) so it gets labelled as an illness instead of a disorder.\n\nOnly labeling people with a disorder when it gets 'bad enough to require help' is another dumb thing psychologists do. It would be like only labeling someone as having a cold if it gets bad enough to go to the hospital, which is clearly illogical. It's also completely arbitrary as some people may be able to hide the quirks of their personality better than others, and therefore avoid being labelled as 'disordered'.""]"
