# Introduction

There's courses you don't have to worry about too much and then there is Big Data. This guide offers some basic tools and strategies that we think you might find useful, so that you put your amazing research ideas into work without getting stuck on the practical bits (although you will most likely get stuck anyways). This is by no means all you should know or all you should expect you should know (and not officially a part of the course content). These are just some things that previous students on the course found important to know. We hope it helps.

## How to use this guide 

Just flick through the pages and find whatever is useful to you.



## General strategies for the course

This course is hard so prepare to kiss your first class honours goodbye. But if you put the effort in, it's highly rewarding, no matter what mark you get.

 - The main part of the course is your research project, which is grounded in what you learn in the lectures and tutorials (so you better show up to them).

 - Participate, ask questions, talk to Zach, he's there to help (and we are here too).

 - You will learn by doing (and googling when things don't work - follow on to the next section).

## How to search for stuff you don't understand 

1. Learn how to read documentation for libraries/functions, most can be found on CRAN.

  - you can search a function in the documentation by typing this into the console:

```{r}
?cor.test
```

  - you can also use two question marks to search the documentation for a word or a phrase:
  
```{r}
??tokenize
```

2. Most packages have a tutorial or readme document that explains how and when to use them. (search for them!)

3. ChatGPT can help with code but using it means you won't actually understand the code. Better to just follow a tutorial and implement it yourself. 




## About us 

We survived the course.


<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

<!-- ## Usage  -->

<!-- Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. -->

<!-- Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`. -->

<!-- The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. -->

<!-- ## Render book -->

<!-- You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: -->

<!-- 1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and -->

<!-- 1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. -->

<!-- Or build the book from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::render_book() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>. -->

<!-- ## Preview book -->

<!-- As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::serve_book() -->
<!-- ``` 
<!-- ```{r include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
